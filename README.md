## üí° About the project

- Mirror Fashion is a hands-on course that begins with the basics of HTML and CSS, including topics related to what's new in the HTML5 and CSS3 versions. Then, the JavaScript programming language is addressed, to enrich the pages of the site with interactions and effects, both with pure JavaScript and with the jQuery library, today the industry standard.
